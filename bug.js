This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a dependency array that includes a function.  React Native may not correctly detect changes to the function, leading to unexpected behavior or infinite loops.  This is because React Native compares function references, not their content.  If the function's internal state changes, the `useEffect` hook might not re-run, even if the logic inside depends on the new state.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const myFunction = () => {
    // Some logic that changes over time
    console.log('Function called');
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect called');
    // Some side effects
  }, [myFunction]); // This is where the bug may occur

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
